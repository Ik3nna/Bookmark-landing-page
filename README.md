I developed a bookmark landing page. This project introduced me to the border-bottom property in CSS. I also got to utilize javascript more in setting up the FAQ section of the project and some other functionalities in the webpage.
I would like to appreciate my friend that put me through during the development of this project and frontend mentor for providing the files used in the development of this project
